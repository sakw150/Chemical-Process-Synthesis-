# Chemical Process Synthesis (Design)


The main objective of this report is utilization of a solar thermal reactor to gasify feed
biomass and convert it into syngas. The chemical plant is divided into an upstream that operates
eight hours a day, 365 days a year, and a downstream that operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a
year and a total of 8000 hours per year. The upstream segment of the plant contains major
equipment such as: solar reactor, spray quench, cyclone, ZnO cleaning bed reactor,
shell-and-tube heat exchangers and methanol bed reactor. As for the downstream, major
components are a storage tank and a distillation column. Both sections of the plant are located in
Daggett, California. The consumerâ€™s request is to produce 56 million methanol gallons per year,
with a purity of 99.97%.

The following components were reviewed and designed: 
1) Methanol Reactor 
2) Solar Reactor 
3) Zinc Oxide Reactor 
4) Components: Pumps, Compressors, Heat Exchangers, Spray Quench Tank, Separators, Heliostat 

Financial and economic statements were generated based on process conditions.
